Game Title:   Rectacular

Game by:      Oddlyfun Games

IDE:          Gamemaker Studio


The purpose of this game was to prove I can actually finish a project even if its small in scope. This was a personal game jam. I gave myself 4 days to design and develop a game. I also gave myself the restriction on a single art source for the game. A finished project is something that is playable with no major crashes and has a game loop which you could replay if a person wanted to. I also want to put the source code out there just for fun and maybe someone could learn something from it.
